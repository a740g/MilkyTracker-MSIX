# MilkyTracker MSIX Package

This is the [MSIX package](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9NT0RLNLNB6C) source for [MilkyTracker](https://github.com/milkytracker/MilkyTracker). MilkyTracker is an open source, multi-platform music application for creating [.MOD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD_(file_format)) and [.XM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XM_(file_format)) [module files](https://milkytracker.org/about/module-files). It attempts to recreate the module replay and user experience of the popular DOS program [Fasttracker II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Tracker), with special playback modes available for improved Amiga [ProTracker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ProTracker) 2/3 compatibility.
